# WordEvol

WordEvol is a very simple genetic algorithm whose goal is to generate a string equal to an input string through genetic evolution.
The base population is composed of individuals with randomly generated strings. Individuals combine with each other and select the ones that best fit the input string. The evolution ends when a predetermined number of iterations is reached or the target string is found.
